# Choosing Safe and Suitable Materials for Children's Toys
This poster presents a comprehensive research project conducted for ME 213 - Material Science course at IIT Guwahati. It focuses on the selection and evaluation of sustainable, non-toxic materials in the design and manufacturing of children's toys. The project addresses the technical gaps in conventional toy production by proposing eco-friendly alternatives such as organic cotton, natural rubber, sustainably harvested wood, and bamboo. Detailed methodologies for material testing—including toxicity, durability, and biodegradability assessments—are discussed, along with compliance to safety standards like ASTM F963, CPSIA, and EN71. The poster highlights a design approach that emphasizes modularity for ease of repair, extended product lifespan, and a reduced environmental footprint.
